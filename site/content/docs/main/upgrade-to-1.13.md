title: "Upgrading to Velero 1.13"
layout: docs
---

## Prerequisites

- Velero [v1.12.x][5] installed.

If you're not yet running at least Velero v1.8, see the following:

- [Upgrading to v1.8][1]
- [Upgrading to v1.9][2]
- [Upgrading to v1.10][3]
- [Upgrading to v1.11][4]
- [Upgrading to v1.12][5]

Before upgrading, check the [Velero compatibility matrix](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero#velero-compatibility-matrix) to make sure your version of Kubernetes is supported by the new version of Velero.

## Instructions

**Caution:** Starting in Velero v1.10, kopia has replaced restic as the default uploader. It is now possible to upgrade from a version >= v1.10 directly. However, the procedure for upgrading to v1.13 from a Velero release lower than v1.10 is different.

### Upgrade from v1.10 or higher
1. Install the Velero v1.13 command-line interface (CLI) by following the [instructions here][0].

    Verify that you've properly installed it by running:

    ```bash
    velero version --client-only
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Client:
        Version: v1.13.0
        Git commit: <git SHA>
    ```

2. Update the Velero custom resource definitions (CRDs) to include schema changes across all CRDs that are at the core of the new features in this release:

    ```bash
    velero install --crds-only --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    **NOTE:** Since velero v1.10.0 only v1 CRD will be supported during installation, therefore, the v1.10.0 will only work on Kubernetes version >= v1.16

3. Update the container image used by the Velero deployment, plugin and (optionally) the node agent daemon set:
    ```bash
   # set the container and image of the init container for plugin accordingly,
   # if you are using other plugin
    kubectl set image deployment/velero \
        velero=velero/velero:v1.13.0 \
        velero-plugin-for-aws=velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.9.0 \
        --namespace velero

    # optional, if using the node agent daemonset
    kubectl set image daemonset/node-agent \
        node-agent=velero/velero:v1.13.0 \
        --namespace velero
    ```
4. Confirm that the deployment is up and running with the correct version by running:

    ```bash
    velero version
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Client:
        Version: v1.13.0
        Git commit: <git SHA>

    Server:
        Version: v1.13.0
    ```


### Upgrade from version lower than v1.10.0
The procedure for upgrading from a version lower than v1.10.0 is identical to the procedure above, except for step 3 as shown below.

3. Update the container image and objects fields used by the Velero deployment and, optionally, the restic daemon set:

    ```bash
    # uploader_type value could be restic or kopia
    kubectl get deploy -n velero -ojson \
    | sed "s#\"image\"\: \"velero\/velero\:v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]\"#\"image\"\: \"velero\/velero\:v1.13.0\"#g" \
    | sed "s#\"server\",#\"server\",\"--uploader-type=$uploader_type\",#g" \
    | sed "s#default-volumes-to-restic#default-volumes-to-fs-backup#g" \
    | sed "s#default-restic-prune-frequency#default-repo-maintain-frequency#g" \
    | sed "s#restic-timeout#fs-backup-timeout#g" \
    | kubectl apply -f -

    # optional, if using the restic daemon set
    echo $(kubectl get ds -n velero restic -ojson) \
    | sed "s#\"image\"\: \"velero\/velero\:v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]\"#\"image\"\: \"velero\/velero\:v1.13.0\"#g" \
    | sed "s#\"name\"\: \"restic\"#\"name\"\: \"node-agent\"#g" \
    | sed "s#\[ \"restic\",#\[ \"node-agent\",#g" \
    | kubectl apply -f -
    kubectl delete ds -n velero restic --force --grace-period 0
    ```

## Notes
If upgrading from Velero v1.9.x or lower, there will likely remain some unused resources leftover in the cluster.The can be deleted manually (e.g. using kubectl) at your own discretion:

    - resticrepository CRD and related CRs
    - velero-restic-credentials secret in velero install namespace
